           ▶ Fire detection: the system will send a warning message to a predefined email address and start a fire alarm in real time when the system detect fire from the webcam frame.
           ▶ Missing detection: the system will send a warning message to a predefined email address in real time when the elderly person is missing more than 12 hours from the webcam frame. 


The technologies used was Python programming language, OpenCV, MediaPipe. As a code editor I used PyCharm.
